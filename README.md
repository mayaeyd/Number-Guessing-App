# Number-Guessing-App
This is a fun and out of the box React app. Users will first get a Start Game Screen where they will be able to enter a number between 1 and 99, then they will be transferred to the Game Screen where the phone will start guessing the number and users can help by pressing higher or lower, at this time, the rounds will be logged on the Game Screen in a scrollable Flatlist with a beautiful design. Once the number is guessed, the Game Over screen will be showed with a message indicating the number of rounds that were done by your opponent (the phone) to guess the number.
